        <h3 className="page-heading">Why Did I Create This?</h3>
        <p>
          I've been playing Marvel Puzzle Quest for a few years now (Day 2148 as
          of this writing...), and I love building and utilizing a roster of my
          favorite Marvel heroes and villains. One minor frustration I
          experience with endgame play is the redundant work of figuring out who
          to flag as bonus heroes for the most efficient application of shards.
          That's why I created MPQ Hall Of Champions to automate this task!
        </p>
        <h3 className="page-heading">How It Works</h3>
        <p>
          Users of the time-honored{' '}
          <a href="https://mpq.gamependium.com/">MPQ Gamependium</a> utility
          will notice a similar feel to this application. When you create an
          account, the application will create a seed database for you that
          consists of all characters that give or receive covers from other
          characters as champion rewards. You simply edit that database to match
          your in-game lineup, and you can view an instant report showing you
          who's closest to major rewards like covers, shards, or significant
          amounts of Command Points!
