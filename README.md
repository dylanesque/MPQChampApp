**Background:**

Marvel Puzzle Quest is a tile-matching mobile game (think Candy Crush or Bejeweled) with RPG elements. For those unfamiliar with the game, the basics are summarized on Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Puzzle_Quest). For the purposes of this project, I'm focusing on three specific aspects of the game:

- The option to set certain characters as "bonus heroes", which increases the chances of pulling a cover (or "shards", an in-game reward that players can turn in for covers when they have a certain amount) for that character in in-game rewards.

- "Champion" levels for a character, which happen by over-leveling a character with additional character covers once they've reached the standard maximum level for their specific rarity.

- The rewards that champed characters receive, specifically covers (or shards) for higher-rarity characters that certain characters receive, a mechanic known as "feeding".

**The Problem:**

There are a LOT of characters in the game, and it can be very tedious to figure out where the best application of bonuses can be, particularly in light of the fact that some characters are far more effective than others. There's too much information to reliably remember which particular characters feed others, which characters are closest to a cover as a reward, and whether or not a "fed" character is the optimal beneficiary for a bonus cover. There have been UI improvements in the game geared towards getting more useful information about characters faster, but the central problem remains.

**The Solution:**

This application will allow users to create an account, log in, and edit a database of MPQ characters to reflect their in-game lineup. To keep the app as simple as possible, the available characters will consist only of the in-game characters that give or receive covers as champion level rewards. Once those changes are saved, the user will be able to see a UI that presents them with their roster, sorted within individual rarities, that highlights the characters closest to a major cover reward of some sort.

**A Note on Changes to the MPQ Reward Structure, December 2019:**

In mid-November 2019, MPQ made significant changes to its reward structure, replacing the Bonus Heroes system with shards, a currency that players acquire from opening certain token types that allow them to make more focused progress towards the characters they want to level. At first, it seemed like this change would make this app obsolete since the entire initial point was to have a calculator to tell players where to apply their bonus heroes. After reading through the changes carefully, it became clear that this app is still needed since the main problem of quickly calculating who is receiving the next most useful reward remains.

**Technology Used And Application Flow:**

The back-end of the app will utilize:

- ~~A seed database of the game characters written in JSON, and served using Express. This is deployed on Heroku (found at https://thawing-tor-15752.herokuapp.com/?pretty), as both an exercise for me in deploying a Node API, and to make the basic character data available for anybody else who wanted build supplemental apps for MPQ.~~ **This feature happened, and remains deployed, but it isn't utilized in the current version of the application.**  

- [Hasura](https://hasura.io/) as the database/GraphQL ORM. I've used Hasura previously in professional projects, and I chose it here for its ease of use, flexibility, and easy integration with Auth0 and Apollo Client. 

- [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) for authentication/authorization, since it's one of the most reliable auth solutions. 
  
The front end will be written in:

- React, specifically the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework. Next is an attractive choice for a project like this for a number of reasons that include server-side rendering and (future) image optimization. 

- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) for asset storage and image optimization. The app currently has close to 200 image assets, and that number will increase if and when MPQ adds new feeders/feedees. Cloudinary lets optimize images for performance and saves me the trouble of having to save image assets in the codebase, which makes the application much more performant.

- Any and all front end testing will likely be done with a mix of [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro), [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), and [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/).


Application flow will work like this:

1. A user signs up for the app, and has a basic database of the relevant characters made available to work with.
2. The user can then customize individual characters in the database via editing power and character levels to reflect the state of their in-game lineup, in an "Edit Roster" screen, and saving those changes.
3. The user can then navigate to a "Roster Status" screen, which will do several things:

   - Filter the list of characters, presenting only characters with one or more power levels added.
   - Present lists of the characters, organized into individual rarity levels and sorted to highlight the characters closest to their next in-game reward.

**Development Phases:**

**Phase One:** This phase will consist of creating and configuring Hasura, Auth0, and the basic Next.js app skeleton, and getting these parts communicating and working as expected. **This phase is complete.**

**Phase Two:** This phase will consist of getting the seed database updated, plus writing, testing, and implementing all Hasura GraphQL queries and mutations. When this phase is complete, the back-end of the app will be essentially finished. While I won't be writing automated tests at this point, I will be earmarking portions of code that need to have tests written for at a later date. **This phase is completed.**

**Phase Three:** I will begin to introduce basic styling at this point, flesh out individual pages, etc. When this phase is complete, the MVP of the application will be complete, and I'll deploy the app for basic user testing. **This phase is completed.**

**Phase Four:** This phase will consist of more advanced styling and comprehensive cross-browser testing. Automated testing will begin, and I will be focusing my energy on getting the finer details of the character report page filtering and other features on that page complete. Changes based on user feedback will begin, and a data caching solution will be implemented at this point.

**Phase Five:** This phase will consist of more checks for advanced styling (such as animation), accessibility, performance, and redundant/non-performant code. 

**Future Enhancements:**

Some things for me to consider in the future after the MVP is finished:

- Adding [progressive web app](https://web.dev/what-are-pwas/) functionality.
- Creating a mobile version of the app in [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- Deeper logic in the application that accounts for some cover rewards being more useful than others, some characters being more useful than others, and other (somewhat subjective) metrics.

** What I learned from this project **

**Don't Finalize the Data Models Without Writing Specs For Front-End Data Flow, Or Considering Back-End Quirks**: There was a small amount of wasted effort in the character models in the form of:
- a feeder attribute which played no part in the application flow
- a convention of linking feeders/feedees via a system of character ids which turned out to be (a) unnecessary, (b) hard to reason about, and (c) formatted as the wrong type for Hasura, namely an array of integers. A minor quirk of Hasura is that it doesn't currently support arrays as a data type, only as many-to-one relationship, making them unwieldly if you don't need them to be indexed, etc.
- On that note, I still needed to store feedees as an array sometimes. The solution turned out to simply to store it as a string, and have a function that splits the string into an array if necessary. 

All of the above could have been caught sooner had I taken a more careful approach to planning, including drafting UI components using a solution like Storybook. 

**Use TypeScript for any full-fledged web applications, such as this one**
